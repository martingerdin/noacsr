\arguments{
\item{user}{Character or NULL. The default is NULL in which case
the username is read from the corresponding environment
variable called DB_USERNAME, using Sys.getenv("DB_USERNAME").}

\item{password}{Character. The default is NULL in which case the
password is read from the corresponding environment variable
called DB_PASSWORD, using Sys.getenv("DB_PASSWORD").}

\item{db.name}{Character. The name of the database. No default.}

\item{table.names}{Character. The name(s) of the table(s) in the
database. No default.}

\item{ignore.missing.table}{Logical. If TRUE the function will
continue even if a table with the name specified in table.names
does not exist in the database. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{env.file}{Character. The name of the file defining the
environment variables used to connect to the database. Defaults
to ".env".}

\item{ask}{Logical. If TRUE you will be prompted to enter your user
name and password to access the database, if these are not
available as environment variables. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{test}{Logical. If TRUE the test, also called scrambled,
version of the data will be imported. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{silent}{Logical. If FALSE a message is displayed with the

\description{
Function to import data from the local MariaDB database. This
assumes that your username and password are available as the
environment variables DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD. \code{noacsr} uses
the package \code{dotenv} to access environment variables and load any
.env file in the project directory. We therefore recommed storing
the username and password in an .env file in the project directory,
but make sure this file is ignored by git so that you don't put it
in version control by mistake. If you created your project with
\code{noacsr::create()} then this has been taken care of.
